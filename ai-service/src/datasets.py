"""
Synthetic training data for the three NyaySetu models.

WHY SYNTHETIC
-------------
Real case data cannot be used, and pretending otherwise would be the single
most dishonest thing this project could do:

  * Evidence metadata from live investigations is protected material. A student
    project has no lawful route to it.
  * Bail outcome data linked to individuals is personal data under the DPDP Act
    2023 and is not published in a linkable form.
  * The National Judicial Data Grid publishes aggregate pendency, not the
    per-case feature vectors a delay regressor needs. Where a real NJDG extract
    is available, load_case_delay() can be replaced by reading it; the feature
    contract is documented so the swap is a single function.

So every generator below is a declared distribution, chosen to be realistic in
shape rather than accurate in fact. The distributions are written out in full so
a reviewer can judge what the models learned, and every API response carries
model_version, which encodes "synthetic".

WHAT THIS MEANS FOR THE CLAIMS
------------------------------
These models are decision support, not evidence. The anomaly detector's value
is that its verdict is anchored and therefore cannot be quietly removed; the
verdict itself is a prompt for a human to look, never a finding of tampering.
