/**
 * Court documents: produced here, and emailed from here.
 *
 * WHY THE SERVER RENDERS THEM AND NOT THE BROWSER
 *   A charge sheet has to be identical every time it is produced, and it has to
 *   contain everything the record holds rather than whatever a screen had loaded.
 *   Rendering in the browser would make the document a function of the client's
 *   state, its fonts and its filters. Rendering here makes it a function of the
 *   database.
 *
 * WHY THE DIGEST IS RECORDED
 *   Every rendering is hashed and the hash written to the action log. That turns
 *   "is this the report you filed in March" into a question with an answer, without
 *   storing a copy of every PDF anybody ever generated.
