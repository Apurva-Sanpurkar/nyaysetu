/**
 * The Bharatiya Nyaya Sanhita, 2023, as reference data the API can check an FIR
 * against.
 *
 * WHY THIS EXISTS
 *   A case's `sections` field used to accept any string up to forty characters.
 *   "BNS 303", "303", "s.303", "BSN 303" and "" were all equally acceptable, which
 *   means the field recorded what somebody typed rather than what they charged.
 *   Every later question — how serious is this offence, which chapter of the code
 *   does it fall under, is this even a real section — was unanswerable.
 *
 * WHAT IT DOES NOT DO: REJECT
 *   A real FIR cites the Sanhita and special legislation together — the NDPS Act,
 *   POCSO, the IT Act, the Arms Act, none of which are in the BNS. An API that
 *   refused anything it did not recognise would refuse most genuine charge sheets.
 *   So references are ENRICHED, not validated: a BNS section gains its title, its
 *   chapter and its punishment, and everything else passes through untouched and
 *   marked unrecognised.
 *
 * SEVERITY IS A LOWER BOUND
 *   Where a section states a punishment, the severity derived from it is correct.
 *   Where it does not, the reason is either that the section only defines the
 *   offence — 303 defines theft, 305 punishes a species of it — or that the source
 *   transcription kept only the defining sub-section. Those two are
 *   indistinguishable from the data, so an absent severity is reported as unknown
 *   and never substituted with a default. A model that received "mild" here when
 *   the truth was "ten years" would be worse than one that received nothing.
