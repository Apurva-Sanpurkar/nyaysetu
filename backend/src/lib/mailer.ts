/**
 * Outbound email over SMTP.
 *
 * Three things this module is careful about:
 *
 * 1. **It never logs an address or a code.** `email_log` records a masked
 *    recipient and a status, so "I never received the code" is answerable
 *    without the log becoming a directory of who is on bail.
 *
 * 2. **It degrades rather than failing.** If SMTP is not configured, sending
 *    returns `skipped` and the caller decides what that means. Login MFA treats
 *    it as "MFA unavailable, fall through to password-only"; a summons
 *    notification treats it as "nothing to do". Neither crashes.
 *
 * 3. **It verifies the connection once, lazily.** A wrong app password is the
 *    most common misconfiguration here, and finding out on the first real OTP is
 *    worse than finding out at boot.
