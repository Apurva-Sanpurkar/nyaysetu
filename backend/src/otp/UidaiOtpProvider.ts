/**
 * ===========================================================================
 * THE REAL UIDAI INTEGRATION SEAM
 * ===========================================================================
 *
 * This class is where an authorised deployment plugs in. It is complete as far
 * as a student project can legally take it, and it deliberately refuses to
 * fake the part it cannot do.
 *
 * WHAT IS MISSING AND WHY
 * -----------------------
 * The Aadhaar OTP API is not open. Reaching it requires:
 *
 *   1. AUA (Authentication User Agency) or Sub-AUA registration with UIDAI,
 *      granted under the Aadhaar (Authentication) Regulations 2016.
 *   2. An ASA (Authentication Service Agency) to carry the request, because an
 *      AUA never connects to CIDR directly.
 *   3. A UIDAI-issued licence key and an AUA code.
 *   4. A digital signature certificate: every Auth XML must be signed, and the
 *      PID block must be encrypted with the UIDAI public certificate.
 *   5. An audited deployment. UIDAI mandates the ASA link, log retention rules
 *      and a security audit before production traffic is allowed.
 *
 * None of that can be obtained by a college project, and UIDAI does not issue
 * a public sandbox that returns real OTPs. Inventing credentials here would be
 * a security theatre: it would look integrated and authenticate nobody.
 *
 * WHAT THIS CLASS DOES
 * --------------------
 * It encodes the real protocol shape so an authorised operator can finish it:
 *   - POST {UIDAI_BASE_URL}/otp/2.5/{ac}/{uid0}/{uid1}/{licence}
 *       body: signed Otp XML, txn correlator, channel = 00 (SMS + email)
 *   - POST {UIDAI_BASE_URL}/auth/2.5/{ac}/{uid0}/{uid1}/{licence}
 *       body: signed Auth XML wrapping an encrypted PID block with the OTP
 *
 * It refuses to start without credentials rather than degrading to a stub,
 * because an OTP provider that silently succeeds is worse than one that is
 * plainly absent.
 *
 * TO ACTIVATE (authorised deployments only)
 * -----------------------------------------
 *   1. Set OTP_PROVIDER=uidai plus UIDAI_BASE_URL, UIDAI_CLIENT_ID,
 *      UIDAI_CLIENT_SECRET and UIDAI_AUA_CODE.
 *   2. Mount the signing certificate and the UIDAI public certificate, and fill
 *      in buildSignedOtpXml / buildSignedAuthXml below.
 *   3. Keep NyaySetu's own rule: the Aadhaar number is used to build the
 *      request and then discarded. Only the token is persisted. The
 *      aadhaarNumber field on these requests exists because UIDAI needs it in
 *      the URL path; it must never be written to a database or a log.
