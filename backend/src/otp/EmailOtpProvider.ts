/**
 * Email OTP, over the deployment's own SMTP server.
 *
 * Used for the sign-in second factor, not for citizen actions. The distinction
 * matters: an emailed code proves control of a mailbox, which is the right
 * assurance for "is this really Inspector Deshpande at her terminal". It is not
 * the right assurance for "did this specific Aadhaar holder acknowledge a
 * summons", which is why the two channels stay separate and a challenge issued
 * on one cannot be verified through the other.
 *
 * Unlike the Aadhaar sandbox, this provider is genuinely real. The code is
 * delivered by a working mail server to an address the operator controls, so
 * `isAuthorisedForProduction` is true: nothing about it is simulated.
