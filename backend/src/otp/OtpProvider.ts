/**
 * The Aadhaar OTP seam.
 *
 * ----------------------------------------------------------------------------
 * READ THIS BEFORE SWAPPING IN A REAL PROVIDER
 *
 * Authenticating against the live UIDAI Aadhaar OTP API requires being a
 * licensed AUA/KUA. That licence is granted by UIDAI to government departments
 * and to entities they authorise, under the Aadhaar Act 2016 and the
 * Authentication Regulations. A student project cannot obtain it, and there is
 * no sandbox that issues real OTPs to real Aadhaar holders.
 *
 * NyaySetu therefore ships two implementations of one interface:
 *
 *   SandboxAadhaarProvider  generates and verifies OTPs locally, with the same
 *                           lifecycle the real API has: a 6 digit code, a
 *                           short TTL, a capped attempt count, single use.
 *                           This is what the demo runs on.
 *
 *   UidaiOtpProvider        the real integration. The request and response
 *                           shapes, the endpoints and the licence checks are
 *                           written out. It refuses to run without credentials
 *                           rather than pretending to work.
 *
 * Nothing above this interface knows which one is active. Swapping providers is
 * an environment variable, not a code change, and that is the point: the
 * dependency on government authorisation is isolated to one file.
