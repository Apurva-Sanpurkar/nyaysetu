/**
 * The handbook.
 *
 * Written for somebody who has never seen the platform and does not know what a
 * hash is. That shapes three choices:
 *
 *   - It explains the one idea (a digest) before any screen, because every other
 *     concept here is downstream of it and none of them land without it.
 *   - The role walkthroughs are tabs, not a long scroll. A police officer should
 *     not have to read the judge's workflow to find their own, and a person
 *     reading on a phone at a scene has no patience for that.
 *   - It is public. A defence lawyer or an accused person needs to understand
 *     what the system claims about them before they have an account, and putting
 *     this behind a login would defeat the point.

  },
  {
    q: "Is my evidence file public because it is on a blockchain?",
    a: "No, and this is the most common misunderstanding. The file is never on the blockchain. Only its digest is, which reveals nothing about the contents. The file itself is encrypted with AES-256 before it is stored, and the key never leaves the server.",
  },
  {
    q: "Why two different one-time codes?",
    a: "They answer different questions. The code emailed when you sign in proves you control the account. The code for acknowledging a summons or filing a check-in goes to the mobile registered against your Aadhaar and proves a specific person did a specific legal act. Treating them as interchangeable would weaken the second one.",
  },
  {
    q: "What if I lose my phone signal at a scene?",
    a: "Registration needs a connection, because the transaction has to reach the chain. Capture the item and the position when you have signal. The digest is computed on the device either way, so nothing about the file changes while you wait.",
  },
  {
    q: "Can an administrator change something after the fact?",
    a: "They can change database rows, and both audit layers will record it. What they cannot change is anything anchored on chain: a digest, a custody confirmation, a check-in, a violation, an intake flag. If the database and the chain disagree, the verification screen says so, and the chain is authoritative.",
  },
  {
    q: "What happens if I submit the wrong file by mistake?",
    a: "It is refused and the mismatch is recorded. That is not a black mark against you; the record shows a check was run and failed, not who was at fault. Find the right file and submit again.",
  },
  {
    q: "The system says a subsystem is unavailable. Is my work lost?",
    a: "No. Each part degrades separately. If the model service is down, screening reports itself skipped rather than claiming an item is clean. If email is down, sign-in falls back to a password. If the chain is unreachable, anything not yet anchored is held and clearly marked as not anchored, rather than being shown as verified.",
  },
  {
    q: "Why is the defence allowed to see the evidence chain at all?",
    a: "Because a verification nobody can perform proves nothing. The point of the design is that counsel can check integrity without trusting the prosecution. They get the custody trail and the verification tool, and no write access to prosecution records and no file downloads.",

                  There are three moments in a criminal case where the record depends entirely on
                  somebody&apos;s word. Was this evidence altered between the scene and the
                  courtroom? Was the accused actually served with the summons? Did they keep the
                  conditions of their bail? In each case the usual answer is a register, an
                  endorsement or a signed undertaking, and each of those is only as reliable as the
                  person who wrote it.

                  NyaySetu does not replace any of that paperwork. It adds one thing to it: a short
                  number, recorded in a place that nobody involved in the case controls, against
                  which the claim can be checked later by anybody. That is the whole idea. Everything
                  you will see in the interface is a consequence of it.

                  Take any file: a photograph, a video, a PDF. There is a standard calculation called
                  SHA-256 that turns it into a 64-character number. The same file always produces the
                  same number. A different file essentially never does.

                <p>
                  The useful part is how sensitive it is. Change a single pixel in a photograph, add
                  one space to a document, re-save a video at a slightly different quality, and the
                  number that comes out is completely different. Not slightly different: unrecognisably
                  different.
