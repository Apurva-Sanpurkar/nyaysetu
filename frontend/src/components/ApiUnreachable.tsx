/**
 * Shown when the app cannot reach its API at all.
 *
 * This exists because the failure it describes used to be invisible. `/me` would
 * fail for a reason that was not 401, the router would read "no session" and
 * redirect to sign-in, sign-in would fail the same way, and the person looking at
 * it would conclude that the portal was broken. The cause — a missing API
 * address, a CORS list that does not name this site, a sleeping free-tier
 * instance — was only visible in a browser console nobody opens.
 *
 * So the app says which address it tried and what is worth checking, in the order
 * things actually go wrong. A blank screen is never the honest answer.
